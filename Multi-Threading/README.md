# 🧵 Multithreading Example using ThreadPoolExecutor in Python

This project demonstrates how to execute multiple tasks concurrently using Python’s built-in `ThreadPoolExecutor`.  
It provides a simple example of how threads work in parallel to improve performance in I/O-bound operations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The project simulates multiple independent tasks (such as processing records) that run concurrently.  
Each task is executed by a separate thread within a thread pool, and thread information is printed to help visualize how work is distributed.

## 🧠 High-Level Flow

1. **Initialize ThreadPoolExecutor**  
   A thread pool is created with a fixed number of worker threads.

2. **Submit Tasks**  
   Each task (record) is submitted to the executor for parallel processing.

3. **Thread Execution**  
   Every thread runs a common function that:
   - Prints the thread name handling the task  
   - Performs simulated work (e.g., using `sleep`)  
   - Prints a completion message  

4. **Result Handling**  
   The main thread waits for all tasks to finish and collects their results.  
   Completed and failed tasks are reported appropriately.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Multithreading:** Running multiple threads simultaneously for concurrent execution.  
- **ThreadPoolExecutor:** Efficiently manages a pool of reusable threads.  
- **Future Objects:** Used to track the state and results of running tasks.  
- **Graceful Completion:** Ensures all threads finish and results are handled safely.

## 🧩 Use Cases

This pattern is useful when:
- You need to perform multiple I/O-bound operations (e.g., API calls, file downloads).  
- You want to speed up independent operations using concurrency.  
- You want to monitor which thread is executing each task.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- No external dependencies — uses only the standard library.
